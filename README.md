# ReactiveZipZap
Bridging ZipZap to ReactiveCocoa with some hopefully useful things.

ZIP files don't include extended attributes.  For my purposes, archiving and unarchiving them is absolutely necessary; 
consequentially, I've added in some code that archives and unarchives these in a (hopefully) useful and painless way.
